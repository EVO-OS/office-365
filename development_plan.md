# Development Plan for Linux Office Suite with Advanced AI Integration

## 1. UI Development

### 1.1 Inspiration from Microsoft's Fluent Design System
- Implement a clean, modern interface with emphasis on typography and iconography
- Use depth and layering to create a sense of hierarchy
- Incorporate fluid animations and transitions

### 1.2 Inspiration from GitHub Copilot's Interface
- Design a minimalist, code-editor-like interface for document editing
- Implement an intelligent suggestion system that appears inline with user input

### 1.3 Advanced Button Designs
- Create flat, modern buttons with subtle hover effects
- Use iconography in buttons to enhance visual comprehension
- Implement a consistent color scheme for different button actions (e.g., primary, secondary, danger)

### 1.4 GTK Implementation
- Utilize GTK for creating the user interface, ensuring Linux compatibility
- Customize GTK widgets to align with the Fluent Design System aesthetics

## 2. AI Integration

### 2.1 Team Collaboration Features (inspired by Team Copilot)
- Implement AI-assisted meeting facilitation within the office suite
- Develop AI-powered group collaboration tools for document co-authoring
- Create an AI project manager to track tasks and deadlines

### 2.2 Custom AI Agents (inspired by Custom Copilots)
- Develop a framework for creating custom AI agents to automate specific business processes
- Implement a system for AI agents to reason over user inputs and actions
- Create a feedback mechanism for AI agents to learn and improve over time

### 2.3 AI Extensions and Connectors
- Design an API for third-party developers to create AI extensions for the office suite
- Implement a connector system to integrate AI capabilities with external data sources and business systems

### 2.4 Text-to-Text Generation
- Integrate advanced text generation capabilities using llama3 (not GPT-2)
- Implement context-aware text suggestions and auto-completion

### 2.5 Auto Modeling and Development
- Utilize llama3 for implementing auto modeling features in spreadsheet applications
- Develop AI-assisted code generation for macros and scripts within the office suite

## 3. Compatibility and Feature Parity

### 3.1 Google Office Compatibility
- Ensure file format compatibility with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides
- Implement real-time collaboration features similar to Google Office

### 3.2 Microsoft Office 365 Compatibility
- Ensure file format compatibility with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint
- Implement cloud storage and syncing capabilities similar to OneDrive integration

## 4. Linux-Specific Considerations

### 4.1 Open-Source Integration
- Ensure all components of the office suite are open-source and compatible with Linux distributions
- Implement integration with common Linux desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc.)

### 4.2 Performance Optimization
- Optimize the office suite for performance on various Linux hardware configurations
- Implement efficient memory management and resource utilization

## 5. Next Steps
- Develop detailed mockups for each component of the office suite
- Create a prototype of the AI integration using llama3
- Begin implementation of core UI components using GTK

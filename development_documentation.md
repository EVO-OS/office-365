## 6. Development Process
1. Initial planning and requirement gathering
2. Setting up the development environment (GTK, Python)
3. Implementing basic functionalities for each component (Word Processor, Presentation Tool, Spreadsheet)
4. Designing and implementing the UI using GTK
5. Integrating Llama3 for AI capabilities
6. Implementing advanced AI features (text generation, summarization, translation, etc.)
7. Testing and refinement of all components and features

## 7. Future Development
- Implementing additional Microsoft 365-like features
- Building automated ppt, words, .docx, and more extensions
- Enhancing collaboration tools and cloud integration
- Optimizing performance for various Linux hardware configurations
- Ensuring compatibility with Google Office and Microsoft Office 365 file formats
- Developing an API for third-party developers to create AI extensions

## 8. UI Enhancements
- UI developed using GTK, targeting GTK 3.20 and later versions
- Design inspired by LibreOffice's interface, with modern elements from Microsoft's Fluent Design System and GitHub Copilot
- Main window size increased to 1024x768 pixels for improved usability
- Updated toolbar with grouped buttons and separators for better organization
- Tooltips added to buttons for enhanced user experience
- Sidebar implemented with sections for Styles and Formatting, Navigator, and Properties
- Tabbed interface (GtkNotebook) added for multiple document support
- Status bar included at the bottom of the window
- CSS styles updated to match LibreOffice's look and feel, with custom styles for buttons and sidebar sections
- Styles dropdown menu added to the toolbar for quick access to text styles
- AI Assist button styled as a suggested action for prominence
- Responsive and adaptable design suitable for various Linux distributions and hardware configurations

These UI enhancements aim to create a familiar yet modern interface for Linux users, combining the best elements of LibreOffice with advanced features inspired by contemporary office suites. The design is responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and resolutions, making it suitable for various Linux distributions and hardware configurations.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the development process and key features of our Linux office suite with advanced AI integration. As development progresses, this document will be updated to reflect new features, improvements, and milestones achieved.
